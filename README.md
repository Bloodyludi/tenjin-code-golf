# Code Golf

## TL;DR

Write the smallest program possible.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo into your own github account.
1. Read `README.md` file in the directory of the current problem.
1. Create a PR with your solution inside that directory, in the format `<username>.<filetype>`. You may submit more than one language, and you may submit more than 1 solution per language (e.g. My PR could have the following 3 submissions `hc5duke.js`, `hc5duke.18.rb`, and `hc5duke.30.rb` for Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 3.0)
1. You may include any additional instructions (e.g. required language version, how to run the language, etc) in the pull request description, or you can include `<username>.md`.

## Scoring
1. The solution with the fewest points wins in each of these three categories: compiled, interpreted, and esoteric.
1. The solution must work. Incorrect/incomplete implementations will be disqualified.
1. Unless otherwise stated, only system libraries are allowed, and assume the code will run without Internet access.
1. Each byte of the solution file counts as a single point. Whitespace, comments, and shebangs all count.
1. If the solution requires changes to CLI, this will count towards the points. E.g. if your ruby script requires this command line option `ruby -np test.rb` your solution will incur 4 additional points (`-np` and required space)
1. In case of anything not covered here or unclear, point values will be determined at the judge's discretion.

## Honor system

*There are no prizes here so don't cheat!*

* Looking up syntax in stackexchange is fine, but don't look up the problem in stackexchange.
* Asking an LLM how to do something is fine, but don't ask it to write a code golf solution in a given language.
* Other people's solutions may be public. Looking at how long someone's python solution is is fine, but don't take a peek to see how they did something.
